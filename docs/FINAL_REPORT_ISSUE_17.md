## Test Results

### Manual Testing ✅

Script: `scripts/test-address-validation.js`

| Test Case                 | Result                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Valid checksummed address | ✅ Pass                      |
| Valid lowercase address   | ✅ Pass                      |
| Valid uppercase address   | ✅ Pass                      |
| Invalid hex character     | ✅ Pass (correctly rejected) |
| Wrong length (41 chars)   | ✅ Pass (correctly rejected) |
| Missing 0x prefix         | ✅ Pass (correctly rejected) |
| Invalid checksum          | ✅ Pass (correctly rejected) |

**Result:** 7/7 tests pass (100%)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ **Approve and merge** this review PR
2. 📝 **Create sub-issue** using template in `docs/SUB_ISSUE_TEMPLATE_REVIEW_17.md`
3. 📝 **Assign developer** to add test coverage

### Follow-up Issue

The sub-issue should track:

- [ ] Unit tests for `addressValidation.js`
- [ ] Component tests for `AddressInput.jsx`
- [ ] Integration tests for WalletConnect validation
- [ ] Target: >80% code coverage

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

### Future Enhancements (Low Priority)

- Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, reduced motion)
- Internationalization for error messages
- ENS name resolution support
- Performance optimization (debouncing)

---

## Conclusion

✅ **The implementation of Issue #17 is APPROVED.**

The wallet address validation feature has been implemented to a high standard with:

- Clean, well-documented code
- Proper error handling
- Excellent user experience
- Good security practices
- No critical issues

The only significant gap is automated test coverage, which should be addressed in a follow-up issue but does not block approval of the implementation.
